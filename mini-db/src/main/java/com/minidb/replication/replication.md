  The key components of the replication system are:

   * Replicator: The master-side coordinator that streams WAL entries to slaves.
   * SlaveNode: The slave-side component that applies the incoming WAL stream.
   * LogStreamer: A utility for reading WAL segments incrementally and sending them to
     slaves.
   * SyncProtocol: Defines the replication message types and protocol constants.
   * Message: Encapsulates a replication message, handling serialization and
     deserialization.
   * SocketChannel: An abstraction for the network communication channel between the
     master and slave.

  1. Replicator.java - The Master-Side Coordinator

  The Replicator.java class is the master-side coordinator, responsible for managing the replication process.
  It streams Write-Ahead Log (WAL) entries to the slaves and keeps track of their progress.

  Detailed Implementation:

   * `Replicator(WALManager walManager, int port)`: The constructor initializes the Replicator with a
     WALManager and a port to listen on for slave connections. It also creates a LogStreamer to read from the
     WAL.
   * `start()`: This method starts the replication process. It registers the Replicator as a WALListener to
     receive notifications of new log records, creates a ServerSocket to accept slave connections, and submits
     a task to the replicationExecutor to handle incoming connections.
   * `acceptConnections()`: This method runs in a loop, accepting new slave connections. For each new
     connection, it creates a TcpSocketChannel and submits a new task to the replicationExecutor to handle the
     new slave.
   * `handleNewSlave(Socket slaveSocket)`: This method is responsible for handling a new slave connection. It
     creates a TcpSocketChannel for the slave and sets a message handler to process messages from the slave.
   * `handleSlaveMessage(SocketChannel channel, Message message)`: This method is called whenever a message is
     received from a slave. It uses a switch statement to handle different message types:
       * `HELLO`: When a HELLO message is received, the handleHello() method is called.
       * `ACK`: When an ACK message is received, the handleAck() method is called.
   * `handleAck(SocketChannel channel, Message message)`: This method updates the slave's lastAckLSN and
     lastHeartbeat in the slaves map.
   * `handleHello(SocketChannel channel, Message message)`: This method creates a new ReplicationState for the
     slave and adds it to the slaves map. It then submits a task to the replicationExecutor to stream any
     historical records that the slave might have missed.
   * `streamHistoricalRecords(ReplicationState slave, long fromLsn)`: This method streams historical WAL
     records to a slave that is behind. It creates a new LogStreamer and starts streaming records from the
     slave's last acknowledged LSN.
   * `onNewRecord(LogRecord record)`: This method is called by the WALManager whenever a new log record is
     written. It sends the new record to all active slaves.
   * `sendRecordToSlave(ReplicationState slave, LogRecord record)`: This method sends a single WAL record to a
     slave.
   * `close()`: This method stops the replication process, closes all slave connections, and shuts down the
     replicationExecutor.

  Interaction with Outside Workflow:

   * The Replicator interacts with the WALManager by registering itself as a WALListener. This allows the
     Replicator to be notified of new WAL records, which it can then send to the slaves.
   * The Replicator is started by the main application, which is responsible for creating the WALManager and
     the Replicator.

  2. SlaveNode.java - The Slave-Side Component

  The SlaveNode.java class is the slave-side component, responsible for applying the incoming WAL stream from
  the master.

  Detailed Implementation:

   * `SlaveNode(String masterHost, int masterPort, WALManager walManager)`: The constructor initializes the
     SlaveNode with the master's host and port, and a WALManager to apply the incoming WAL records to. It also
     creates a TcpSocketChannel to communicate with the master.
   * `start()`: This method starts the slave node. It connects to the master, sets a message handler to
     process messages from the master, and sends a HELLO message to the master.
   * `handleMasterMessage(Message message)`: This method is called whenever a message is received from the
     master. It uses a switch statement to handle different message types:
       * `STREAM_WAL`: When a STREAM_WAL message is received, the handleStreamWal() method is called.
   * `handleStreamWal(Message message)`: This method applies the incoming WAL records to the WALManager. It
     then sends an ACK message to the master to acknowledge receipt of the records.
   * `saveState()` and `loadState()`: These methods are used to save and load the slave's state (i.e., the
     last applied LSN) to a file. This allows the slave to resume replication from where it left off if it is
     restarted.
   * `close()`: This method closes the connection to the master and saves the slave's state.

  Interaction with Outside Workflow:

   * The SlaveNode interacts with the WALManager by calling the appendPredefinedAndFlush() method to apply the
     incoming WAL records.
   * The SlaveNode is started by the main application on the slave machine.

  3. LogStreamer.java - The WAL Streamer

  The LogStreamer.java class is a utility for reading WAL segments incrementally and sending them to the
  slaves.

  Detailed Implementation:

   * `LogStreamer(WALManager walManager)`: The constructor initializes the LogStreamer with a WALManager.
   * `startFrom(long lsn)`: This method starts streaming from a specific LSN. It gets a FileChannel from the
     WALManager and scans from the beginning to find the starting LSN.
   * `hasNext()` and `next()`: These methods are part of the Iterator interface and are used to iterate over
     the WAL records.
   * `readNextRecordInternal()`: This method reads the next WAL record from the FileChannel.
   * `close()`: This method closes the FileChannel.

  4. ReplicationState.java - The State of a Slave

  The ReplicationState.java class holds the state of a slave, including its ID, the SocketChannel used to
  communicate with it, the last acknowledged LSN, the last sent LSN, and the last heartbeat time.

  5. SyncProtocol.java - The Replication Protocol Definition

  The SyncProtocol.java class defines the replication message types and protocol constants. It uses an enum to
   define the different message types, such as HELLO, STREAM_WAL, ACK, PING, PONG, and RESYNC.

  6. transport/Message.java - The Message Format

  The transport/Message.java class encapsulates a replication message and handles its serialization and
  deserialization. It defines the message frame structure and provides static factory methods for creating
  different types of messages.

  7. transport/SocketChannel.java and transport/TcpSocketChannel.java - The Transport Layer

  The transport/SocketChannel.java interface and its implementation, transport/TcpSocketChannel.java, provide
  an abstraction for the network communication channel between the master and slave. The TcpSocketChannel uses
   a java.net.Socket for communication and handles the reading and writing of messages.

  8. LogReceiver.java - The Log Receiver

  The LogReceiver.java class is a placeholder and is not fully implemented. It is intended to receive the WAL
  stream and write it to a local buffer or queue.

  I hope this detailed explanation gives you a better understanding of the replication implementation in your
  mini-database. Let me know if you have any other questions.
